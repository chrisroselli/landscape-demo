    <p class="text-l text-primary">Web Developer</p>
    <p class="text-base mt-4">I have been working in web development for over 10 years. I also have a background in graphic design and photographer. I started my journey at Central Connecticut State University with a BA in Graphic/Information Design. My years at Central where some of my favorite. I was fortunate to be offered the opportunity to work within the department, where I gained valuable experience in both design and technology as their lead technician. After graduating, I then held several positions spanning from print to web design. Eventually I landed on web development as my true passion and have been building my skill set in this amazing digital realm ever since.</p>
    <p class="mt-4">I have been a New Englander all my life and am a resident of Cheshire, CT. I enjoy running, especially on our beautiful Heritage Canal Trail. My family owns a small hobby farm in Colchester, CT raising everything from Nigerian goats to miniature donkeys.</p>
